# Resources Import Summary

## Overview
Successfully processed the MITWPU Infrastructure CSV data and generated SQL statements to insert resources into the `resources` table.

## Files Generated
1. **`generated_resources_insert.sql`** - Main SQL file with INSERT statements (11,211 lines)
2. **`process_resources.py`** - Python script used to process the CSV data
3. **`insert_resources.sql`** - Initial manual SQL template (for reference)

## Processing Results
- **Total Records Processed**: 2,207 rows from CSV
- **Resources Generated**: 862 SQL INSERT statements
- **Records Skipped**: 1,345 (non-academic spaces like washrooms, hostels, offices)

### Resource Type Distribution
- **Classrooms**: 312 resources
- **Laboratories**: 294 resources  
- **Halls**: 21 resources
- **Others**: 235 resources (conference rooms, libraries, study areas, etc.)

## Data Mapping

### Building Names
All building names from the CSV were successfully mapped to existing building UUIDs in the database. Alternative naming conventions were handled (e.g., "DHRUV A" vs "DHRUV - A").

### Floor Numbers
Floor designations were converted from CSV format to database format:
- `GF` → `0` (Ground Floor)
- `1F`, `2F`, etc. → `1`, `2`, etc.
- `B1`, `B2`, etc. → `-1`, `-2`, etc. (Basement levels)

### Resource Types
CSV categories were mapped to the enum values in the database:
- `CLASSROOM` → `classroom`
- `LABORATORY`, `COMPUTER LABORATORY` → `lab`
- `SEMINAR HALL`, `DRAWING HALL`, `AUDITORIUM` → `hall`
- Everything else → `others`

### Data Extracted
For each resource, the following data was extracted:
- **Room Number**: From "Room No." column
- **Capacity**: From "Capacity" column
- **Description**: Combination of Category, School, and Department
- **Equipment**: Details from furniture and technology columns (benches, chairs, computers, etc.)

## How to Execute

### Option 1: Direct SQL Execution
```sql
-- Run the generated SQL file against your Supabase database
\i generated_resources_insert.sql
```

### Option 2: Supabase Dashboard
1. Open your Supabase project dashboard
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `generated_resources_insert.sql`
4. Execute the script

### Option 3: Programmatic Execution
```bash
# Using psql
psql -h your-supabase-host -U postgres -d postgres -f generated_resources_insert.sql
```

## Data Quality Notes

### Skipped Categories
The following room types were intentionally excluded as they are not bookable academic resources:
- WASHROOM
- HOSTEL  
- UTILITY ROOM
- STORE
- OFFICE
- DINING HALL
- CANTEEN
- GUEST HOUSE

### Included Categories
Academic and bookable spaces that were included:
- CLASSROOM
- LABORATORY / COMPUTER LABORATORY  
- SEMINAR HALL / DRAWING HALL
- AUDITORIUM
- LIBRARY / READING HALL
- CONFERENCE rooms
- GD ROOM (Group Discussion)
- STUDIO spaces
- COLLABORATION AREA
- BREAKOUT AREA

## Validation Recommendations

Before executing the SQL:

1. **Backup your database** - Always backup before bulk inserts
2. **Test on staging** - Run on a test environment first
3. **Verify floor mappings** - Ensure all buildings have the required floors in your `floors` table
4. **Check resource types** - Verify the `resource_type` enum has all required values

## Post-Execution Steps

After running the SQL:

1. **Verify record count**: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM resources;`
2. **Check distribution**: `SELECT type, COUNT(*) FROM resources GROUP BY type;`
3. **Validate relationships**: Ensure all `building_id` and `floor_id` references exist
4. **Review sample data**: Check a few random records for data quality

## Technical Details

### Script Features
- Handles CSV with BOM (Byte Order Mark)
- Cleans and validates data
- Generates unique UUIDs for each resource
- Properly escapes SQL strings
- Uses subqueries to resolve floor_id from building_id and floor_number

### Error Handling
- Skips records with missing essential data
- Warns about unknown building names
- Handles various floor number formats
- Validates capacity as numeric

The generated SQL is ready for production use and follows the existing database schema constraints.
